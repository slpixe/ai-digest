# Micromatch Integration Plan

## 1. Create a Micromatch Utility Module
- Create a new file at `src/utils/micromatchUtils.ts` to house the new functions.
- Leverage the micromatch library to filter file paths using include/exclude patterns.

## 2. Implement Filtering Functions
- **filterFiles(files: string[], includePatterns?: string[], excludePatterns?: string[]): string[]**
  - Uses micromatch to verify inclusion and exclusion of file paths.
- **createMicromatchFilter(patterns: string[]): (file: string) => boolean**
  - Returns a function that checks a file path against given glob patterns.

## 3. Integration with the Existing Codebase
- Update the file processing pipeline to use the new micromatch filters:
  - Integrate into `src/aggregator/gatherFiles.ts` and `src/aggregator/processFile.ts`
  - Replace or complement existing ignore-based filtering with micromatch where appropriate.

## 4. Testing
- Ensure tests (e.g., `tests/advancedIncludeExclude.test.ts`) pass after integration.
- Refactor tests if necessary to cover micromatch filtering behavior.

## 5. Future Enhancements
- Optimize performance further and include detailed logging for pattern matching.
